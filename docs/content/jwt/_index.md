“JSON Web Tokens are an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for
representing claims securely between two parties.” (jwt.io)

The JWT stratgey allows to use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to secure your
plumber endpoints. A great introduction to JWT can be found
[here](https://jwt.io/introduction/). JWT can be used to secure REST
APIs without sessions. They are considered to be stateless although they
can also be used as stateful session tokens.
